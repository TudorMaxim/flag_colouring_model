## Flag Colouring Model

This project serves as my dissertation for my master's degree at King's College London.

## TODOs

* Complete fitness function
* Start with a population with valid solutions only
* Crossover - change entire colour classes instead of randomly cutting 2 points
* Explore if replacing the entire population can produce better solutions
* Add weights for teacher preferences
