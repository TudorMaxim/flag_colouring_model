## Flag Colouring Model

### Introduction

This project serves as my dissertation for my master's degree at King's College London. It implements heuristic algorithms to solve the university timetabling problem using graph colouring. Also, a genetic algorithm is designed and implemented to improve the solutions found by algorithms like LDO, DSATUR and RLF.

### Deliverables

The software is available in 2 variants:

* CLI - by running the `main.py` file from `src` folder.
* GUI - by running the `app.py` file from `src` folder

Datasets where generated using `dataset_generator.py` file from `src` folder.

### Code Structure

* The source code is structured in 7 packages under the `src` folder.
* Unit tests are implemented in `tests` folder

### Instalation and Usage

* In order to run this project, please install the latest version of Anaconda3 and Python.
